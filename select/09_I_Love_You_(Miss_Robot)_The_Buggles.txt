You make love like a metronome
Don't drive to fast when you take me home
Touch the seam on your sliver skin
I feel so hard when you take me in

I love you miss robot
Electronically
I love you miss robot
Electronically

Talk of love on the telephone
When your voice fades theres a paying tone
Force a coin and your there again
And my lonliness is payed away

I love you miss robot
Programmed just to please
I love you miss robot
Electronically

I must leave miss robot
Give yourself to me
I love you miss robot
Do you love me?

I love you miss robot
Electronically
I love you miss robot
Programmed just to please

I must leave miss robot
Give yourself to me
